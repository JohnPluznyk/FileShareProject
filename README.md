# FileShareProject
A web application meant to allow users to access the web servers files.  This is just supposed to be a fun little project to help me learn javascript.  Once I have the main functionality of the project complete I will then update it with typescript so that I can have an understanding of why a developer would want to use typescript in the first place.  After understanding typescript I then plan trying to incorparate REACT.  Again this project is meant for me to develop my web skills.

Lastly, I have a linux machine laying around the house that I may try to set this up on and utilize this with.  I just wish to have a system where I can backup all my files on and access them through the my own web app.
